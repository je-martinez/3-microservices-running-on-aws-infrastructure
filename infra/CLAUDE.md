# CLAUDE.md — infrastructure

Nested project memory for the **Terraform/AWS infrastructure**. Source of truth
for the infra stack and conventions. The global `infra-impl` agent reads this
first, every time. Cross-cutting rules are **referenced**, never duplicated.

## 1. Stack & versions
- IaC: Terraform (own modules; no flat resources).
- Naming: cloudposse/label/null module.
- Cloud: AWS (ECS Fargate + ECR, SQS + Lambda, API Gateway + ALB, Cognito, Route 53, Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, DocumentDB, Aurora Postgres/MySQL).
- Lambda source lives in-repo: `modules/cognito/pre-token-lambda/` (nodejs20.x),
  packaged with the `hashicorp/archive` provider. It is the repo's first Lambda.
- Local: Floci (ADR-0017; superseded Ministack).

## 2. Commands
- Init: `terraform init`
- Validate: `terraform validate`
- Format: `terraform fmt -recursive`
- Plan: `terraform plan`
- Apply: `terraform apply`

> These run per environment under `environments/<env>/`; the configurations
> themselves are created in the infrastructure implementation milestone.

### Local AWS — Floci
Local development runs against **Floci** (local AWS emulator: SQS, Lambda, ECS,
RDS, S3, DocumentDB, …). The **root `docker-compose.yml`** brings it up as the
`floci` service on `3mrai-network`, exposed at `http://localhost:4566`
(in-network: `http://floci:4566`). It is the substrate where local AWS resources
are created; Terraform's `environments/local` and the service SDKs target this
endpoint (`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`). Lambda/ECS execute as real Docker containers, so
Floci mounts the docker socket and joins them to the same compose network
(`FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_DOCKER_NETWORK=3mrai_3mrai-network`). State persists under
`./data/floci` (git-ignored) with `FLOCI_STORAGE_MODE=persistent`.

**`make bootstrap` is the single supported entry point.** It runs, in order:
`floci` → `infra-init` → `infra-up` (phase-1 apply + regenerate `./.env` from
outputs via `env-file`) → **`migrate`** (Prisma `migrate deploy`) → build/start
`users` → `bootstrap.sh` (`nginx-stable` alias) → **`infra-up-post`** (phase 2:
least-privilege DB app-users in Terraform — see the two-phase section below) →
services. The order matters: `users` validates `COGNITO_*` with Zod at boot, and
those IDs only exist after apply — and Floci mints new ones on every apply, so
`.env` is generated, never hand-edited.

Other targets: `make infra-up|infra-down|infra-output`, `make env-file` (rewrites
only the AUTO-GENERATED block in `./.env`, preserving manual vars), `make migrate`,
`make clean` (teardown), `make observability-up|observability-down`.

There are now **two RDS clusters** locally — Users **Postgres** and Orders
**MySQL 8.0** — both from the same engine-agnostic `rds-aurora` module (second
instantiation with `engine = "mysql"`, letter-led `mysql-${label}` id). Both run
`manage_app_user = false`; the least-privilege app users (`users_app` Postgres,
`orders_app` MySQL — each SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE, no DELETE per ADR-0004) are
created post-apply by the **phase-2** `environments/local/post/` root (see the
two-phase apply section below), not inside the phase-1 module. Locally only
`users_app` is created — Floci hangs the mysql provider, so `orders_app` is
prod-only.

Postgres is reached at `floci:<port>` (Floci's RDS proxy port), never by
container IP — Floci reassigns those on every recreation. **Proxy ports are
discovered per-engine, not hardcoded:** Floci assigns them (7000–7099) by cluster
**creation order**, which is NOT stable across applies, so Postgres/MySQL can flip
between 7001/7002 (verified). The single discovery mechanism is
`environments/local/scripts/discover-db-port.sh <engine>`, which reads
`aws rds describe-db-clusters --query "DBClusters[?Engine=='<engine>'].Port"`
(the `Engine` field is stable); the Makefile (`env-file`, `migrate`,
`infra-up-post`) and `bootstrap.sh` all call it, and `env-file` writes the results
to `.env` as `USERS_DB_PORT`/`ORDERS_DB_PORT` for docker-compose to interpolate.
Writer and reader endpoints are the same locally: Floci does not emulate an Aurora
read replica.

Known limitation: a **second** `terraform apply` fails (Floci's `UpdateTags` for
API GW v2 / RDS). Re-apply by tearing down and rebuilding, not by re-running
apply. See [../docs/lessons/floci-rds-apigw-limits.md](../docs/lessons/floci-rds-apigw-limits.md).

### Two-phase apply — phase 2 (`environments/local/post/`)
`make bootstrap` runs a second Terraform apply (**phase 2**, `infra-up-post`)
**after** phase 1 (cluster + endpoints exist) and after `bootstrap.sh` — see the
`make bootstrap` order below. Phase 2 lives in `environments/local/post/` with
its **own** (gitignored) state, so it never re-touches phase 1's resources
(which would trip the second-apply `UpdateTags` limit above).

Phase 2 creates the least-privilege **DB app-users in Terraform** via the
engine-parameterized `modules/db-app-user` — replacing the old bash
`bootstrap_app_db_user` step. It reads phase 1's outputs (`db_writer_endpoint`,
`orders_db_writer_endpoint`, `secret_arn`) via `terraform_remote_state`, and the
master credentials **by ARN** via `aws_secretsmanager_secret_version`
(secret-only: no password ever lives in a variable/tfvars/output/`.env`). Each
app-user gets a `random_password` written to its own Secrets Manager secret.
A `terraform_data` + `local-exec` **wait-for-db gate** (`gate.tf` +
`scripts/wait-for-db.sh`, probing over `3mrai_3mrai-network`) blocks app-user
creation until the DB accepts connections.

**Per-engine gating** (`enabled_app_users`): local enables **postgres only**
(`users_app`) — Floci **hangs** the mysql provider; **prod** enables both
(`users_app` + `orders_app`). Grants stay SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE, **no DELETE**
(ADR-0004). See [environments/local/post/README.md](environments/local/post/README.md).

Updated `make bootstrap` order: `floci` → `infra-init` → `infra-up` (phase 1
apply + `env-file`) → `migrate` → build/start `users` → `bootstrap.sh`
(nginx-stable alias) → **`infra-up-post`** (phase 2: DB app-users) → services.

## 3. Folder structure
```
infra/
├── modules/
│     label/        — cloudposse/label wrapper (naming)
│     networking/   — VPC, subnets, security group
│     compute/      — nginx on ECS (njs injects x-user-id; see ADR-0016)
│     api-gateway/  — API GW v2, per-route HTTP_PROXY integrations, JWT authorizer
│     cognito/      — user pool (+ custom:app_user_id), app client, and the repo's
│                     first Lambda: Pre-Token-Generation V2 (pre-token-lambda/)
│     rds-aurora/   — Aurora cluster (writer + reader)
│     database/, messaging/  — empty placeholders
└── environments/{local,production}/
```

Two modules are wired against Floci with the **awscli-fallback pattern**
(`terraform_data` + `local-exec` + an idempotent script, outside Terraform's
resource lifecycle) because native resources cannot work there: the Cognito app
client and the Pre-Token V2 trigger. See [[awscli-fallback-for-floci]] and
[[cognito-pre-token-lambda]]. The AWS provider is pinned `= 5.31.0`.

### Env files are generated here
`environments/local/scripts/generate_env_files.py` writes all five env files from
Terraform outputs; `make env-file` runs it, and `infra-up` ends by calling that —
so every file exists before any service starts. That ordering is load-bearing now
that services read `.env.local.<service>` via compose `env_file:`.

- Rewrites only each file's **AUTO-GENERATED** box; the **CUSTOM** box is preserved.
- Every value is REQUIRED: a missing Terraform output raises, naming it, rather
  than writing an empty segment into a connection string (a service that starts
  and then cannot connect is far harder to diagnose).
- **No interpolation in the output.** `env_file:` takes values literally, so ports
  and ids are resolved as the file is written — a `${...}` left behind would reach
  the service as that literal string.
- Adding a service: add its entry to the generator and an `env_file:` line to its
  compose service. Declare nothing inline — `environment:` silently wins.

### Infra scripts are Python
All five infra scripts are Python (`bootstrap.py`, `scripts/discover_db_port.py`,
`post/scripts/wait_for_db.py`, `modules/cognito/scripts/create_user_pool_client.py`,
`modules/cognito/scripts/set_pre_token_trigger.py`) — there are **no `.sh` files** left.

- They import shared helpers from `infra/scripts/lib3mrai/` (`aws.py` boto3 factory
  honoring `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, `console.py` ok/no/inf, `db.py` discover_port/wait_for_db).
  Add shared logic there rather than duplicating it per script.
- Each script stays **colocated** with the Terraform module that invokes it.
- `local-exec` provisioners call the venv interpreter by **absolute path**, passed in as
  `var.python_bin` (the root module resolves it from its own `path.root`; the shared
  cognito module requires it with no default, so a wrong wiring fails at plan time).
  Never plain `python3` — the ambient one may resolve into an unrelated venv.
- `make scripts-setup` creates `.venv/` and is a prerequisite of every apply target, so a
  fresh clone cannot hit `python: not found` from inside an apply.
- When porting or editing, preserve the external interface: CLI args, exit codes, env var
  names, state-file shapes, and stdout purity where the Makefile captures it.

## 5. Agent rules
- Converse with the user in **Spanish**; write config and comments in **English**.
- `infra-impl` writes **only Terraform/config** — never runs git or touches Linear.
- Leave finished work in the working tree for the **main session** to commit
  (`github-ops` is an optional helper for complex git batches — see [[git-workflow]]).
- Stay within the single task handed to you (YAGNI).
