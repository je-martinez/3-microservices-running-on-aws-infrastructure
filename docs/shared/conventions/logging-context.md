# Logging Context

## The shared log context

Every log line attaches the following fields, identically defined across services:

| Field | Source | Present when |
|---|---|---|
| `trace_id` / `span_id` | OpenTelemetry SDK (W3C) | always |
| `cognito_sub` | JWT / `x-user-id` | authenticated request |
| `user_id` | internal resolution (`usr_…`) | once identity resolved |
| `email_hash` | SHA-256 of the trimmed, lowercased email, first 16 hex chars | whenever the email is known |
| `email` | request body, **masked** | auth flows only (register/login) |
| `order_id` | domain operation | Orders operations |
| `duration_ms` | request log | per response |
| `tracking_id` | — | **reserved** for `tracking`, emitted by nothing today |
| `type` | — | **reserved** for `events-pipeline`, emitted by nothing today |

**Rule: unknown fields are OMITTED, never emitted as null.** A `user_id: null` reads as a
resolved value that happens to be null, not as "not applicable to this line" — that ambiguity is
worse than the field's absence.

## PII rules

- `email_hash` = SHA-256 of the trimmed, lowercased email, hex-encoded, **first 16 characters**.
  This is a **cross-service contract**: Users' `hashEmail` and Orders' `EmailHash.Compute` must
  agree exactly on normalization and truncation, or cross-service filtering by email silently
  fails to correlate instead of erroring. Both pin the literal `b4c9a289323b21a0` for
  `user@example.com` in a test, so a drift fails in CI rather than silently returning no results.
- Plaintext email is **never** logged. Auth flows (register/login) log a **partially masked**
  form instead: `john.doe@gmail.com` → `jo*****e@gmail.com` — local part masked (first 2 and
  last 1 character visible), domain fully visible because it carries operational signal (e.g.
  which provider is failing) and identifies nobody on its own.
- Never log passwords, tokens, or full request bodies.

> [!warning] Pitfall — mask at the call site, not in the ambient context
> The masked email goes on the **log call site**, not in the AsyncLocalStorage context. Putting
> it in the ambient per-request context leaked it onto every later line of the request, including
> the unrelated `request completed` line.

## Flow logs

Only flows with real diagnostic value get explicit logs: `register`, `login`, `create-order`.
Trivial CRUD keeps only the automatic request log — noise is what makes logs unread.

Pattern: `<flow>_started` / `<flow>_succeeded` / `<flow>_failed` in an `app_event` field, plus a
`reason` field on failures, one branch per failure mode **that actually exists in the code** (not
a speculative list).

**There is no `SUCCESS` severity, by design.** The original input asked for a `[SUCCESS]` level;
it is not an OpenTelemetry severity (the spec defines `TRACE`/`DEBUG`/`INFO`/`WARN`/`ERROR`/
`FATAL`), and inventing one would break the alignment that makes `severity` color correctly and
lets standard severity filters work. Success is `INFO` + `app_event=*_succeeded`. Query patterns:

```sql
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE app_event LIKE '%_succeeded'
SELECT app_event, count(*) FROM logs WHERE app_event LIKE 'register_%' GROUP BY app_event
```

## OTel configuration belongs in the environment, not in code

Three separate faults traced back to configuring the SDK in code when the OTLP spec already
defines an environment variable for it. **Each failed silently** — spans were produced, nothing
arrived at the collector, and nothing complained.

| Setting | What went wrong | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Endpoint path | Orders POSTed to the collector root, got a 404 | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is a **base** URL; the SDK appends `/v1/traces` itself. Never hand-build the full path. |
| Protocol | .NET defaulted to gRPC (`4317`) against the HTTP port (`4318`) | Always set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` explicitly — Node and .NET default to different protocols. |
| Metrics/logs exporters | `NodeSDK` auto-detects both from the endpoint; the collector only serves `/v1/traces` | Set `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none` and `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=none`. An `undefined` SDK option reads as "not overridden," so auto-detection still wins — this cannot be fixed from code. |

**Rule: reach for the standard environment variable first; write code only for what has no
variable.** A new service needs **no** endpoint or protocol code — only these env vars set in
`docker-compose.yml`. Also enable the SDK's own diagnostics (`diag.setLogger` /
`OTEL_DIAGNOSTICS__LOGLEVEL`) on any new integration — a silently-dropped exporter is how all
three of the faults above went unnoticed for as long as they did.

**ESM note (Users):** Users is `"type": "module"`, where static imports are hoisted and resolved
before any module body runs. The OTel SDK must be loaded via `node --import`, not imported
"first" inside the entrypoint file — otherwise instrumented libraries are already in the module
graph before `sdk.start()` runs, and their instrumentation silently never patches.

## Severity must reach the record's native fields

Writing `severity_text`/`severity_number` only as log attributes leaves them queryable but
invisible in dashboards: OpenObserve colors charts from the record's own native `severity` field,
which was `0` (`UNSPECIFIED`) for every row across the system. Every chart rendered as one
undifferentiated color. The collector now mirrors both values onto the native fields so severity
coloring and filters work as expected.

## What belongs in the log stream

> [!info] Guiding rule
> A request should appear **once**, logged by the layer with the most context. Edge/proxy logs
> are ingested only for failures the application layer cannot observe — 5xx, upstream errors, and
> anything the parser could not classify.

nginx access logs under 500 are dropped by the collector: for a 2xx/3xx/4xx, the service already
logs the same request with the *why*. 5xx are kept — verified by stopping the users container and
hitting its route, which produced `nginx ERROR GET /v1/users/health 502`, a failure no service
could record because none was running to record it.

Non-JSON sources (like nginx's combined log format) need explicit parsing in the collector to
reach the shared schema.

> [!warning] Do not filter or alert on `cloudwatch_log_stream`
> Under the local emulator, the `aws_cloudwatch` receiver substitutes the placeholder
> `THIS IS INVALID STREAM` when it cannot resolve a real stream name. Use `service_name` and
> `cloudwatch_log_group_name` instead.

## Per-service mechanism

- **Users:** an AsyncLocalStorage store (`shared/logging/log-context.ts`), a sibling to the audit
  `actor-context.ts`, merged into every record by Pino's `formatters.log`.
  > [!warning] Pitfall — Prisma's lazy promises break ALS
  > Prisma promises are lazy; any `await` must happen **inside** the ALS callback, or the context
  > is already gone by the time the query runs. See [[2026-07-12-prisma-lazy-promise-als]].
- **Orders:** a Serilog `ILogEventEnricher` reading `ICurrentCaller` via `IHttpContextAccessor`.
  The caller is read on **every** event, never cached — the internal `usr_` id resolves lazily
  and is absent early in a request.
